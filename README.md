# ScreenDoor
Finds the Screen Door Quotient (SDQ) of a country artist
The SDQ is the number of times the words "screen door" appear in their songs

# Features
- Counts all instances of "screen door" in an artist's discographies
- Supports Songmeanings.com only
- VERY SLOW, takes minutes to do one artist

# TODO
- Generalize the screen door search to other words
- Parallelize the request process so it doesn't take so long
- Support other websites?... or figure out a better API solution that isn't just pure web scraping
- Automate process for multiple artists to compare SDQs
